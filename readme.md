An simple application made with MEAN stack.

###A MEAN Twitter Clone###

Here I'm using the whole MEAN stack - Mongo, Express, Angular, and Node -- to build out a simple but robust app. 


The app includes Mongoose as a ODM for Model and storing data into MongoDB,
Express with authentication, custom routes and a RESTapi that handles the calls to Mongo,
Angular and Bootstrap to help us create the UI , 
and Node.js as our server.
